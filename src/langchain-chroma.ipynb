Adequate amounts should, therefore, be supplied in thedaily diet. Some of the water-soluble vitamins are partly lost in cooking procedures. This factor has tobe kept in mind while meeting their requirements.\\nVitamin B-Complex\\nA number of substances have been identified and grouped together under this heading. It must be\\nnoted that each of the B vitamins is a separate vitamin in name, structure and function.\\nSix members of this group, namely, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, pyridoxine, folic acid and vitamin\\nB12 are included in the RDA, because definite requirements of these vitamins have been established', metadata={'source': 'data/fundamentals-of-foodnutrition-and-diet-therapy.pdf', 'page': 112}),\n",

They isolated 100 mg of crystals from 100 kg of rice polishings. Subsequently, itwas synthesised in 1936 by R.R. Williams and is now available in the market in the form of thiaminhydrochloride.\\nThe name thiamin is derived from its chemical ringlike structure. Thiamin consists of substituted\\npyrimidine and thiazole rings linked by a methylene bridge. It exists mainly in various inter-convertiblephosphorylated forms, chiefly thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP). It is very soluble in water and is readilybroken down by heat in neutral or alkaline solutions.', metadata={'source': 'data/fundamentals-of-foodnutrition-and-diet-therapy.pdf', 'page': 112}),\n",

This reaction releases energy in the system.\\nThiamin is needed to maintain normal function of three systems in the body, gastrointestinal,\\nnervous and cardiovascular system.\\nGastrointestinal System:  Thiamin helps to produce energy needed for the cells of smooth\\nmuscles and secretory glands. In its lack, there is lack of muscle tone and deficient gastric secretions;as a result there is poor appetite, indigestion, constipation and poor stomach function.\\nNervous System:  The central nervous system needs glucose as energy source for its function.', metadata={'source': 'data/fundamentals-of-foodnutrition-and-diet-therapy.pdf', 'page': 112}),\n",
